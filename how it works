add_item function: Adds an item to the list.
remove_item function: Removes an item from the list if it exists.
view_list function: Displays the contents of the list.
search_item function: Checks if an item is present in the list.
main function: This is where the main loop runs, taking user input and calling the appropriate function based on the choice.
